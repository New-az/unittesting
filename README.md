## Problem 1: Count Distinct Elements in a List
  ```public class ListUtil {
    /**
     * Count the number of distinct elements in a list.
     * The list may be empty but not null.
     * TODO: can the list contain null values? Does null count as a unique element?
     *
     * @param list a list of elements
     * @return the number of distinct elements in list
     */
    public static int countUnique(List<?> list)
  ```
   
## Problem 2: Binary Search
  Write a method that searches for an element in an array (Java) or list (Python), where the array or list contents are already sorted.
  Use binary search. Return index of the matching element or -1 if the search element is not in the list/array.
