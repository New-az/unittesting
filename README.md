  This project is for practice unit testing. 
## Problem 1: Count Distinct Elements in a List
  Count the number of distinct elements in a list. The list may be empty but not null.
  
   
## Problem 2: Binary Search
  Write a method that searches for an element in an array (Java) or list (Python), where the array or list contents are already sorted.
  Use binary search. Return index of the matching element or -1 if the search element is not in the list/array.
